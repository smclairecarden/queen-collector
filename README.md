# The Queen-Collector

## About:
  - The Queen Collector is an app for fans of Rupaul's Drag Race to come together to add and favorite their favorite queens. 
  - Users can add a queen, edit the info on queens they have added, and add "Reads", or comments for each queen.
  - I am a longtime fan of the show and felt like this was a fun idea!

## Getting Started:
- launch the app here -
  <a href="https://queen-collector.herokuapp.com">Queen Collector</a>
- After the launching the app, sign in with your google email address.
- Click on 'Add A Queen" to add a queen to the list.
- Click on 'All Queens' to view the full list of queens. 
- Clicking on 'Details' will take you to the selected queens info page. Here you can add the queen to your favorites, and add 'reads'.
- If you have added the queen you click on, Details is also where you can Edit the info.
- The X Button will delete the queen you have added.
- 'Profiles' will take you to all the profiles. You can click on a profile to see queens they have favorited.
- Enjoy!
